# EDTear
This is the "Elite: Dangerous Trade Ear", a service that subscribes to [EDDN](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN)
and produces data archives specifically about trade data.

This will hopefully be useful in a trade route calculator I'm planning to make in the future.

## TODO
- Write to SQLite/Postgres instead of CBOR
